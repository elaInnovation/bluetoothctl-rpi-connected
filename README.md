# bluetoothctl-rpi-cconnected
This repository can be use as a sample to use a raspbery Pi and bluetoothctl to manage ELA Innovation BLE connected mode. Through this example, you will find a series of command to use our tag, the Nordic UARD and send command to our tags. All you need is a Raspbery Pi (use for this sample a Raspbery Pi 3B+) connected to internet and a Tag from ELA Innovation to test connection and send commands.

## Install bluez

## Use bluetoothctl for connection
